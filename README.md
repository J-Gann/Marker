# Marker-Tracking Application
This is a report about the advanced internship ”Frontendentwicklung in React”
(Frontend Development in React). The purpose of the internship was to gain
experience in developing applications with the frontend development framework
for web-apps called React. As part of the internship, the development of an
application was given as a task. The application is a common tool in video
editing software: A visualization of marker-movements through rendering of
corresponding tracks.
The report introduces the topic by presenting an already existing software
solution, describes details about the implementation of the new application
and explains the reason for software design decisions. The functionality of the
application in regard to its main use case is described. The report closes with
an outlook on further improvements.
